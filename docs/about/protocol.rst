Protocol reference
==================

Control port implementation was written based on multiple documentations.

Of course the bible is the `Control Spec`_, published by the `Tor project`_.
The text version is a little bit easier to deal with compared to the `HTML version`_,
which was also used for this project.

Due to many questions left after reading these documents, the `source code of Tor`_ was
also taken into account. It allowed the removal of deprecated commands, replies or events
when they were removed a long time ago, or sometime are described in the documentation but
were never implemented.

This hopefully ensures a better match between our implementation and the real protocol in Tor.
